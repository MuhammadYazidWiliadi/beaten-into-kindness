              <p>
                The inspiration for this novel came from observing the remarkable resilience of individuals who have faced tremendous adversity yet emerged with their capacity for love and kindness not only intact but strengthened.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a world that often seems divided by anger and fear, I wanted to explore the radical possibility that our deepest wounds might actually become our greatest sources of wisdom and compassionâ€”if we choose to let them.
              </p>
